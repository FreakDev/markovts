# MarkovTS

MarkovTS is simply a port of the awesome [MarkovJS](https://github.com/lsunsi/markovjs) but in TypeScript

This project is intented to add some functionality to the original library, but it has the same API yet (see [here](https://github.com/lsunsi/markovjs/blob/master/README.md) for the documentation)

All the credit should go to [lsunsi](https://github.com/lsunsi) 🙏
